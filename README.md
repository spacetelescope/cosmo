COSMO (COS MOnitoring) is a software system that is built specifically for the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) 
team at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). 

COSMO is made up of a series of monitors and their data built on the light-weight 
[monitorframe framework](https://github.com/spacetelescope/monitor-framework).
These monitors are important for ensuring that COS is operating nominally as well as extending its mission lifetime.
